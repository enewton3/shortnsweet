      <h2>History</h2>
      The Old South Chatham School House taught grades one through eight with
      four grades in each of the two rooms. The school served students in South
      and parts of West Chatham as well as a few East Harwich students at
      various times from 1905 to 1927. At this time the village schools were
      consolidated in one building on Main Street in Chatham Center. The School
      building that is currently standing was constructed after a fire had
      destroyed the previous building. The Newtons hired Arthur Ellis to restore
      the interior of the building to a semblance of what the school house may
      have looked like in its earlier days, while also retaining space for their
      own business. While much of the building has changed, much of it remains
      as it was when students attended class here in the early 1900’s.
      <h2>Us</h2>
      Jan and John Newton have been running Short ‘n’ Sweet IceCream in South
      Chatham on Route 28 for 31 years. John is an ex-marine who’s love for
      music and memorabilia shines through when you walk into the shop, from the
      old jukebox to the vietnam war posters. Both Jan and John are dedicated
      runners who have lived on the cape for 52 years and had the pleasure of
      raising their children here as well as being able to spend time with their
      grandchildren. The two of them drive across the country to California and
      spend their winters in Carlsbad. After being in the marines for three
      years and his family living in california, Jan had family on Cape Cod and
      they decided to move across the country. They chose South Chatham as a
      settling point and bought the old school house in 1981. In 1991 Short ‘n’
      Sweet opened and they’ve been scooping ever since.
